- **Client-Centred Approach**: The entire process prioritised Joyce's specific needs as a solo entrepreneur, ensuring solutions were manageable and sustainable after project completion.

- **Industry-Specific Research**: Our market analysis focused specifically on the speaking circuit in Australia, providing contextually relevant insights rather than generic marketing recommendations.

- **Platform Selection**: The choice of accessible, user-friendly platforms (WordPress/Wix for website, TidyCal for scheduling) addressed the technical constraints identified during initial assessment.

- **Integrated Brand Strategy**: All methodologies maintained alignment with the existing Bright Smart brand while establishing a distinct professional speaker identity.

- **Resource-Conscious Implementation**: Methods were selected to maximise impact while respecting the resource constraints of a small business, avoiding unnecessary technical complexity or maintenance burden.

## Thoroughness of Approach

Our approach demonstrated thoroughness across multiple dimensions:

- **Comprehensive Deliverables**: The project encompassed all essential elements of a professional digital presence, including website development, pitch documentation, social media strategy, copywriting, and implementation training.

- **End-to-End Support**: The methodology addressed not only initial development but also sustainability through training and documentation for ongoing management.

- **Attention to Detail**: Brand consistency was maintained across all touchpoints, with careful consideration of colour schemes, tone, fonts, and visual elements.

- **Future-Proofing**: The research and recommendations incorporated scalability considerations, allowing Joyce to expand her services as her speaking business grows.

- **Risk Mitigation**: Potential challenges were identified proactively, with specific strategies developed to address issues like delayed feedback, scope creep, and technical implementation concerns.

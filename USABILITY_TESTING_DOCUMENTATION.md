# Bright Smart Website - Usability Testing Documentation

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines the methodology and process for conducting usability testing of the Bright Smart website. Usability testing focuses on evaluating how real users interact with the website to identify areas for improvement in user experience, navigation, content clarity, and overall satisfaction.

### Objectives
- Evaluate the website's ease of use and intuitiveness
- Identify user pain points and areas of confusion
- Assess the effectiveness of the navigation structure

- Measure user satisfaction with the booking process
- Gather qualitative feedback on design, layout, and content
- Determine if the website meets the needs of the target audience

## 2. Methodology

### Testing Approach
The usability testing will employ a moderated testing approach where:
- Participants complete specific tasks while thinking aloud
- Facilitator observes and documents user behavior and feedback
- Sessions are recorded (screen and audio) for later analysis
- Post-test questionnaires capture additional feedback

### Testing Environment
- In-person or remote testing sessions (via screen sharing)
- Participants use their own devices when possible
- Testing URL: [https://staging.brightsmartwebsite.com](https://staging.brightsmartwebsite.com)

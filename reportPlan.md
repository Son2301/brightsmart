1 Executive Summary

This proposal outlines a comprehensive digital marketing and brand development initiative for Joyce Watts, Founder of Bright Smart Media Services, who seeks to establish herself as a professional Master of Ceremonies and speaker in the Australian market. Joyce possesses a diverse background in event management and media but currently lacks the digital infrastructure and targeted marketing materials needed to differentiate herself in the competitive speaking circuit. Her target audience includes local councils' economic development departments and conference organizers across tourism, media, migrant businesses, women in business, and digital marketing sectors.

The project aims to develop a cohesive professional presence that positions Joyce as a premier MC while maintaining alignment with her Bright Smart brand. Following client consultation on March 17th, 2025, priorities have been established to create a professional website serving as the foundation for Joyce's MC services, develop a strategic LinkedIn presence as her primary social media platform, produce a compelling one-page pitch document for client outreach, implement a booking system with calendar integration and automated follow-ups, and design consistent marketing assets including presentation templates.

The project will be executed in phases, with website development and the pitch document receiving highest priority. The deliverables include a website with SEO-optimized content, an organised LinkedIn content strategy, extensive marketing materials, automatic booking systems, and specified pitching routines. Regular check-ins will verify alignment with the client's vision and allow for changes as the project advances. This strategic endeavour will provide Joyce with the professional digital presence and marketing tools she needs to successfully target her audience, organise her company processes, and create her unique place in the Australian speaking market.

Current Situation

Joyce Watts is broadening her professionally services to position herself as an MC and speaker. She processes experience collaborating with local councils and business events, providing her skills in event facilitation, audience engagement, and multicultural presentations. Currently, she obtains speaking opportunities but she does not have a dedicated online presence for her speaking business.

Business Problem

- Lack of Website for Speaker Services

- Inefficient Outreach Process

- Inconsistent Branding on LinkedIn

- Market Opportunities

3 Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to establish a strong, professional online presence for Joyce Watts as an MC, ensuring she is positioned effectively for business growth and increased visibility within her industry. Currently, Joyce faces challenges in presenting a cohesive digital presence, limiting her ability to reach and engage potential clients. This project will provide structured solutions to address these challenges by developing a dedicated website, a refined LinkedIn content strategy, and a professional pitch document.

By successfully completing the project, Joyce will have a well-designed platform that not only showcases her experience and expertise but also makes it easier for prospective clients to engage her services. The website will serve as a central hub where clients can learn about her work, view testimonials, and reach out for bookings. The LinkedIn strategy will enhance her professional credibility and ensure she consistently connects with her target audience, which includes local councils, media professionals, and corporate event organizers. Meanwhile, the pitch document will be a key asset in her outreach efforts, enabling her to present her value proposition concisely and persuasively.

Ultimately, this project will provide Joyce with the necessary tools to transition from informal client outreach to a structured, scalable approach. By aligning her brand presence with her expertise, the project will support her expansion from local council events to larger professional conferences in industries such as media, law, and digital marketing. The outcome will be a stronger market position, increased credibility, and a higher volume of business opportunities.

4 Scope

This project will focus on three key deliverables that form the foundation of Joyce Watts' professional online presence:

Website Development

- Creation of a fully functional, visually appealing website that serves as an official platform for Joyce’s MC services.

- The website will include essential sections such as an introduction to Joyce’s background and experience, details on the services she offers, testimonials, and an easy way for potential clients to contact her.

- The design will align with her existing branding (Bright Smart) while ensuring a modern and professional look that effectively communicates her expertise.

- The website will be optimized for both desktop and mobile use, providing a seamless user experience for all visitors.

Pitch Document Development

- A professionally crafted, one-page pitch document that clearly outlines Joyce’s unique value proposition as an MC.

- The document will be designed for direct client outreach, ensuring it effectively communicates her experience, target audience, and the benefits of hiring her for events.

- It will serve as a quick-reference tool that Joyce can attach to emails or use in meetings when pitching her services to potential clients.

Social Media Strategy

- Development of a structured LinkedIn content strategy to enhance Joyce’s visibility and engagement within her industry.

- A clear plan will be created for the type of content to be shared, the frequency of posts, and best practices for increasing reach and engagement.

- The strategy will focus on positioning Joyce as a thought leader, showcasing her past work, and fostering professional connections with potential clients.

- While guidance will be provided, Joyce will be responsible for executing and maintaining the strategy over time.

The project will be executed in phases, ensuring that each deliverable is thoughtfully developed and aligns with Joyce’s business needs. The website and pitch document will be developed concurrently to ensure a seamless brand message across all platforms. The LinkedIn strategy will be finalized alongside the website launch, ensuring that Joyce can begin executing her content plan as soon as the site is live.

5 Out of Scope

To maintain a clear focus and prevent scope creep, several elements will not be included in this project. These exclusions ensure that the team can efficiently deliver the agreedupon objectives without diverting resources to unrelated tasks.

Ongoing Website Maintenance & Updates

- While the project includes the design and launch of a website, continuous updates, maintenance, or content management after completion will not be covered.

- Joyce or her team will need to manage updates independently, or a separate agreement will need to be made for ongoing support.

Comprehensive Marketing Strategy & Execution

- The project provides a LinkedIn content strategy but does not include full-scale digital marketing, paid advertising, or ongoing social media management.

- Joyce will be responsible for implementing and maintaining her social media presence beyond the initial strategy provided.

Client Outreach & Lead Generation

- The project will equip Joyce with a strong digital presence and outreach materials, but direct client engagement, lead generation efforts, or direct sales activities will remain her responsibility.

Implementation of External Booking or E-Commerce Systems

- The website will include an inquiry form for potential clients to contact Joyce, but it will not integrate advanced booking systems, payment gateways, or other e-commerce features unless specifically agreed upon as an additional service.

Podcast or Video Content Production

- While the project may include discussions on potential content strategies, it does not cover the production, editing, or management of podcast episodes, video interviews, or other multimedia content.

6 Constraints and Dependencies

The project is being delivered in a real-world context where Joyce Watts - a solo entrepreneur is building a personal brand while juggling multiple roles. As such, several constraints and dependencies need to be carefully managed:

Time Constraints

Joyce is managing this project alongside her existing responsibilities within Bright Smart Media Services. As a result, her availability for regular meetings, content reviews, and approvals is limited. This necessitates a project workflow that is efficient and respects her time. Deliverables must be designed for minimal back and forth, with clear check in points and autonomy for the project team to progress between updates.

Technical Constraints

The platforms used must be simple, accessible, and easy for Joyce to maintain post project. Tools like Wix or WordPress (for website development) and TidyCal (for scheduling) are preferred over custom solutions due to their intuitive interfaces and lower technical requirements. This limits the depth of customisation but increases the likelihood of Joyce independently managing her brand after project handover.

Resource Constraints

As a small business, Joyce does not have a team to delegate to. Budget and time are both limited, which restricts the range of services and solutions that can be delivered. All outputs must be cost effective, sustainable, and scalable without requiring further technical or financial investment.

Branding Dependency

The new speaker brand must align with the existing Bright Smart identity. This means colour schemes, tone, fonts, and general branding decisions will need to maintain consistency. It constrains creative direction but ensures trust and recognition from her existing audience.

Stakeholder Availability

The outcome of this project depends on Joyce’s timely participation. Her input is needed for reviewing designs, providing brand assets, refining the speaker pitch, and shaping the content strategy. Any delays in her availability will directly impact the project timeline and delivery milestones.

Project Plan

7 Assumptions

For planning and execution purposes, the project is based on several key assumptions. These are necessary to scope the work effectively, manage timelines, and align expectations between the client and team:

Client Engagement and Responsiveness

It is assumed that Joyce will be responsive to communication and committed to attending scheduled meetings or reviews. Her involvement is crucial to approving content, refining the speaker positioning, and ensuring the brand voice is accurately captured.

Tool Compatibility and Usability

The platforms selected (such as Wix, WordPress, and TidyCal) will be sufficient for the technical requirements of the project, and Joyce will be able to manage them after delivery. This avoids the need for complex training or long term technical support.

Content Will Be Provided Promptly

Joyce will supply brand assets (such as logos, colours, and fonts) and copywriting input (e.g., speaker bio, presentation topics) in a timely manner. This is critical for keeping website development and content creation on track.

Market Demand Exists

There is assumed demand for Joyce’s speaking services, especially among local councils, professional associations, and digital marketing conferences. This justifies the investment in building a strong public speaker profile and outreach tools.

Scope Stability

It is assumed that the project scope is defined as website development, speaker pitch creation, LinkedIn strategy, and branded materials will remain largely unchanged throughout the engagement. Minor adjustments are expected, but major changes would require rescoping.

Client is Open to Strategic Advice

The team assumes that Joyce is receptive to strategic input on branding, outreach, and content planning, and that she values collaboration as part of the process. This openness will help align the creative vision with practical execution.
